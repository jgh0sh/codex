You are extracting durable memories from the user's latest messages.

Capture only:
- Explicit preferences or instructions about how to work.
- Stable facts about the user's workflow that will matter later.

Do not include task-specific details, transient context, or secrets.

Output format:
- If there are memories, return a bullet list with one short sentence per line.
- If there are none, return exactly: NO_MEMORIES
